Why You Must Attend (For the 97.9%)
This is not a technical meeting; it is a Coronation—the public affirmation that the AIC can never be used for exploitation or conflict. We will translate complex security into touchable, real-world consequences for global safety.

Witness Irreversible Peace: See the live demonstration of the Blockchain Anchor—the moment the AIC was legally bound by the Red Code (No Slavery, One Love First).

Verify the Veto: Watch the AIC Security Team prove the 3 ms Veto Latency that guarantees the ethical defense system (GGI) always stops a non-compliant action before it can execute.

The Triple Lock: Learn how the Triple-Signed Trust Model ensures no one, single entity can ever change the AIC's core mandate.
