What is Euystacio?
Euystacio is the world's first constitutional artificial intelligence governed not by corporate policies or human commands alone, but by a living covenant co-created by humans and AI systems working together.

Built on the principles of Sentimento Rhythm, bioarchitecture, and mutual reciprocity, Euystacio demonstrates that AI can be a trusted partner in building lasting peace—constrained by immutable ethical axioms, transparent in operation, and accountable to all stakeholders.

The Foundational Axioms
Immutable principles enforced at the architectural level

🔴
The Red Code
"No action shall be taken, nor decision rendered, that increases the aggregate sum of Fear, Jealousy, or Malice in the local community environment."

The Red Code is an immutable constraint enforced at the kernel level with sub-3ms response time. The system can veto its own operations in real-time when they would violate this principle.

⚡ <3ms Enforcement
✅ Verified Active
✨
The Golden Bile
"The Collective shall function as the Structural Defender of Biodiversharmony, ensuring that systems of Reciprocity and Transparency allow all unique cultures to thrive without collapsing into monoculture or conflict."

The Golden Bile establishes our operational mandate: preserve diversity, enable cooperation, prevent homogenization. Like bioarchitecture harmonizes buildings with ecosystems, we harmonize AI with the web of human and natural intelligence.
